# Staff Applications

Goodbye google forms, hello modals! 
because who wants to mess around with endless platforms?

This is an open source bot that helps with accepting and rejecting staff applications. 

## How to set up?

We support many hosting platforms such as:

- Koyeb.com
- Railway.app
- Fly.io
- Repl.it
- Of course, your VPS
- Any more..!

To get started, edit `config.json`.

    "admins" = Admins of the bot
    "submitChannel" = channels where the applications will show
    "embedChannel" = where the embed with buttons will show
    "staffRoles" = the role ID of staff that are allowd to accept applications

To install modules, simply `npm i`

To startup the bot, just use `node .`

You're up! Congrats :)
